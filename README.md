# Current files for Bottle project

<h3>Encrypting a message, generating a URL for sharing, and then decrypting once viewed</h3>

This project currently requires the installation of the following modules:
  * pyperclip `pip install pyperclip` (considering incorporating JavaScript)
  * cryptography `pip install cryptography` 

How to test the code:

* The project is dependent on the main Bottle file: 'bottle.py' (already in this repository).
* 'main_bottle2.py' is the primary working file currently, this file will be ran as a python script and will start a server listening on __port 8080__.
* This can be accessed in a browser at '_localhost:8080/message_' - this will bring you to the input prompt for a message at the beginning of the process.

''' This library contains two parts to it; the first is the encryption sequence I created based on
    a Caeser cipher tutorial with some modifications. This requires the generation and usage of a
    One-Time Pad text file. This works fine, except it relies on two text files being stored and
    loaded/deleted.

    The second portion contains crypto functions from the Python module PyCrypto. These are well-known
    algorithms such as AES. All cryptographic functions will be kept in this module and then imported
    into the main Bottle project file.

    This includes an MD5 hashing function - this won't be used on the Bottle project to encrypt
    messages (obviously) but is still being included in case there is future use.

''' This function takes in a plaintext message and an OTP sheet from 
    the ones generated in the first function. Any characters not in
    the ALPHABET/ALPHAUP/PUNC variables are added as-is to the CIPHERTEXT variable.
    The ENCRYPTED value is derived from the index of each character in the ALPHABET
    plus the value in the 0-based corresponding position of the OTP text file.
    This is then modulus divided by the length of the string and the corresponding
    character at the index position is chosen as the ciphertext character.

''' For certain block cipher encryption modes, the plaintext messages have
    to be a multiple of the block size for each algorithm. To ensure that each
    of these functions will perform the prescribed encryption on data of any length,
    padding may be required for certain modes.

    CFB mode, described in a comment under the AES section, turns the block cipher
    into a steam cipher and eliminates the requirement of plaintext to be a multiple
    in length of the block size, nor does it require padding on the plaintext input.
